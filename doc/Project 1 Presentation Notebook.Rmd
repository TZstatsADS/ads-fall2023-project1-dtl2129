## Introduction

In a world as diverse as ours, the pursuit of happiness is a timeless and 
universal quest. What brings joy to one person may differ greatly from another, 
and geography often plays a significant role in shaping our experiences. In our
data-driven age, we have the unique opportunity to explore the intricacies of 
happiness through the lens of geospatial analysis. This blog post delves deep
into a database of "happy moments" contributed by individuals spanning the 
globe. By examining these moments in a geospatial context, we aim to uncover 
the fascinating connections between location, culture, and human well-being. 

## Geographic Distribution of Data Set

First, I think it's important to investigate the data set itself. Where are 
people submitting their happy moments from? Below, I have displayed the number of
responses submitted from each country on a world map. Note that a log scale is
used, as some countries had many more happy moments submitted than other 
countries did.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
renderImage(list(src="../figs/Frequency_Map.png"))
```

<br><br><br>

Here we can see that the data set is drawn primarily from respondents in the 
United States and India. However, many other countries are still represented, 
albeit by much smaller samples.

## Top Words by Country

Now that we've established where the happy moments come from in the data set, 
we can examine what words are being used by people in different countries. The 
interactive below will allow you to investigate what the most used words are
in happy moments from each country. Additionally, the words that are most 
distinct for one country compared to another (as calculated using the TF-IDF 
weights) are also visible in the interactive.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
source("../output/Top Words Shiny App.R")

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

As you may notice, many words, such as "friend" or "time", are commonly used in 
many countries. However, the distinctive words vary greatly between countries 
and may reflect diverse sources of happiness that vary between countries.

## LDA Topic Modeling

One method to investigate what diverse source of happiness exist in the happy 
moments database is Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which will allow us
to identify certain topics that are identifiable in the database. Note that I 
used a Gibbs sampling method in order to produce more discrete and interpretable
topics.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
renderImage(list(src="../figs/Top Terms by Topic.png"))
```

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

As you can see, some patterns begin to emerge in these five topic categories, 
potentially allowing us to see each of them as a source of happiness. 

Topic 1 seems to correspond to shopping or going out, with words like "bought" and 
"trip". 

Topic 2 appears to reflect family and the home as a source of happiness.

Topic 3, meanwhile, seems to center around spending time with friends doing 
activities.

Topic 4, using words like "dinner" and "eat", seems to indicate that food may be
another important source of happiness for individuals.

Finally, topic 5 does not paint a clear picture of a happiness source, instead 
including more nebulous and nonspecific terms we might call generic happiness.

## Topic Prevalence by Country

With these topics now established, we can examine which ones are most 
influential in individual countries. By averaging the topic probabilities of 
each comment in each country, we can obtain a metric to measure the importance 
of each source of happiness in each country. 

### Topic 1 (Shopping) 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
renderImage(list(src="../figs/Topic 1 Terms Map.png"))
```

<br><br>

Shopping and going out appears to be a source of happiness across most nations, 
with particular strength in Central Asia, Europe, and the Southern Cone.

### Topic 2 (At Home with Family)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
renderImage(list(src="../figs/Topic 2 Terms Map.png"))
```

<br><br>

Family is a very important source of happiness globally, although it's influence
is even stronger in South Asia and parts of Northern Europe.

### Topic 3 (Time with Friends)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
renderImage(list(src="../figs/Topic 3 Terms Map.png"))
```

<br><br>

Time with friends does not seem to have a very strong regional pattern, although
some nations (albeit those with small sample sizes) do seem to have their
happiness more influenced by friends.

### Topic 4 (Food)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
renderImage(list(src="../figs/Topic 4 Terms Map.png"))
```

<br><br>

Food is a strong source of happiness throughout much of the world, although 
South Asian nations seem to be affected less by this source of happiness.

### Topic 5 (Generic Happiness)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
renderImage(list(src="../figs/Topic 5 Terms Map.png"))
```

<br><br><br>

Generic happiness, meanwhile, is largely evenly distributed, with only a handful
of countries (which each have a low number of respondents) having this influence
elevated.

## Conclusions

Our geospatial analysis of happiness has illuminated the diverse facets of human well-being across the globe. While the dataset predominantly comprises 
submissions from the United States and India, it offers a rich tapestry of 
joyful moments from various countries. Through word analysis and topic modeling,
we've discerned distinct sources of happiness, such as shopping, family, time 
with friends, food, and a broader sense of generic happiness. These sources 
exhibit varying degrees of influence on happiness across nations, reflecting the
intricate interplay of culture, geography, and individual experiences in the 
pursuit of happiness.

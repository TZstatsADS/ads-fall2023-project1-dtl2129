### Output folder

The output directory contains analysis output, processed datasets, logs, or other processed things.

This file contains each of the data processing steps ("Text_Processing", 
"HappyDB_RShiny", "Top Words Analysis", and "Project 1 Production Notebook").Since 
these files may take significant time to run, their outputs have been preproduced 
and stored in this directory and the figs directory.

It also contains the various RDS and CSV outputs from these files for their access in
the Shiny applications and final presentation notebook

There are two R Shiny files that set up the shiny applications used in the final 
presentation notebook

### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2023

+ Project title: A Geospatial Analysis of Happiness
+ This project is conducted by Daniel Luce

+ Project summary: In this data story, we embarked on a geospatial journey to explore the diversity of human happiness worldwide. Through the analysis of a "happy moments" database, we uncovered distinct sources of joy, from shopping to family, across different countries. Our findings underscore the complex interplay of culture, geography, and individual experiences in shaping happiness on a global scale. .
